# Sitemason Snippets

I'm a developer at Sitemason, and this is a collection of my most often used PHP snippets. Sitemason is a hosted content management platform and uses a PHP templating environment. We have a [public library](http://developer.sitemason.com/library) for common tasks, but PHP is often used with raw Sitemason data to perform specific tasks. 

Some of these snippets are alternate versions of official Sitemason methods, and others are generic development snippets. If you have any questions, please contact billy@sitemason.com.
